(presentation 3) is a Mark type of element.	
(Feri mathematics 4.66667) is a Student type of element

We can solve the problem (find the subject where the average is the greatest) by applying maximum search on Student type of elements.

The Average class enables us to calculate the sum and count of grades for a given subject. As we aim to calculate the two in a combined summation, the func function has to return a (sum,count) pair: 
  
summation
func: Mark -> ZxZ
func(e) = (e.grade,1)

For example:
f((presentation 3)) = (3,1)
f((written-exam 5)) = (5,1)

Then, we have to define what does the addition of two values mean:
a+b = (a1+b1,a2+b2), where 'a' and 'b' are (sum,count) pairs.

The (sum,count) pairs are called Result type of values.
Of course, the neutral element in this case is the (0,0) pair.
